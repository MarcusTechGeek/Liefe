                    My love, this website is for you to read whenever you feel like you miss me
                    or need love from me when I am not available to talk. My love for you is unconditional, 
                    endless, and overflowing. Words cannot describe how much I love you.
                    Since I've known you, you have made my life better and easier by making me 
                    a better me. You are such an amazing wifey, always helping me, loving me, and supporting me
                    where you can. You truly are wifey material, and I would not wish to marry anyone besides you.
                    I want to spend the rest of my life with you and only you, watching our
                    kids grow up, going on trips together, being successful together, and just loving 
                    one another.
                    <br>
                    <br>
                    My Love, there is no doubt in my mind that we will have an amazing and eventful life
                    together. One day, you and I will be on our front porch, old and wrinkly, looking 
                    back at our past and laughing together at all the wonderful memories we made together.
                    One day, I will be old and wrinkly, and I will still love it when you send me your silly videos 
                    from your fyp. We will have cuddles together and a fart-positive relationship, haha.
                    <br><br>
                    Haha, yes, you can have more chins, and we will, for sure, have to get Boltie a friend or two,
                    but don't forget who has to clean up after them in the house, neh ðŸ˜„.
                    <br><br>
                    All I want you to know is that I will love you forever and ever, and I would give you the whole world 
                    when I can. I want you to know that I would give my life to protect you and our family.
                    You are and always will be the love of my life. Remember that, forever and ever.
                    <br><br><br>
                    PS: Yes, I would still love you if you were a Gogga!
                    As long as You are MY GOGGA!
                </p>
                <br>
